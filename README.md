# Brisync
Synchronize your external display brightness with built-in display.

# How it works
Application reads current brightness of your built-in display and passes it to external displays via DDC interface.

You can adjust brightness by a menu in the system status bar. Adjusting brightness in the menu changes internal brightness factor for this display so future brightness updates match your preferences.

# How to install
Download the latest app binary zip file from [here](https://github.com/czarny/Brisync/releases/download/v1.0.0/Brisync.zip). Extract it and copy to your /Applications directory.
